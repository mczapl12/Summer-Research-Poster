# Summer-Research-Poster
Conducted original research under Dr. Enrico Au-Yeung exploring the intersection of Knot Theory and Game Theory. The project involved modeling "unknotting" games using mod-2 linear algebra to derive deterministic decision rules. By computing and interpreting topological invariants—such as the Alexander polynomial and determinant—I developed a parity-based framework to classify and predict "unknot" states. This research demonstrates an ability to reduce complex, non-linear systems into controllable patterns through rigorous mathematical abstraction.
